# Class Database

## Submission

Below you will find a set of tasks for you to complete to set up a databases of students and mentors.

To submit this homework write the correct commands for each question here:

```sql
1.
createdb cyf_classes
psql cyf_classes

2.
CREATE TABLE mentors (
  id        SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name      VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
  glasgow_years     int NOT NULL,
  address   VARCHAR(120),
  fav_prog_language      VARCHAR(50)
);

3.
INSERT INTO mentors (name, glasgow_years, address, fav_prog_language) VALUES ('John Smith','2','11 New Road','React');
INSERT INTO mentors (name, glasgow_years, address, fav_prog_language) VALUES ('Daniel Doe','1','11 New Road','Node');

  id        SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name      VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
  address   VARCHAR(120),
  graduated      VARCHAR(5)
);

5.
INSERT INTO students (name,address,graduated) VALUES
	 ('John Nava','2 New Road','yes'),
	 ('Alexender Flaming','7 Lluna','no'),
	 ('Stuard Broad','10 Sant Pau','no'),

	 ('Newton Dario','11 Banani','no'),
	 ('Juan Albez','15 Paloma','yes');
    
    
6.
SELECT * from mentors;
SELECT * from students;

7.
CREATE TABLE classes (
  id        SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  mentor_id INT REFERENCES mentors(id),
  topic      VARCHAR(30),
  date   DATE NOT NULL,
  location      VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL
);

8.    
INSERT INTO classes (mentor_id,topic,"date","location") VALUES
	 (1,'Node','2020-11-30','online'),
	 (2,'Java','2020-11-30','online'),
	 (3,'C++','2020-11-30','online');

9.
CREATE TABLE attendance (
  id        SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  student_id INT REFERENCES students(id),
  class_id INT REFERENCES classes(id)
);

INSERT INTO attendance (student_id,class_id) VALUES
	 (1,2),
    (3,2),
    (2,1),
    (4,1);

10.
 Retrieve all the mentors who lived more than 5 years in Glasgow
    - Retrieve all the mentors whose favourite language is Javascript
    
    SELECT * FROM mentors WHERE fav_prog_language = 'Javascript';
    
    - Retrieve all the students who are CYF graduates
    
    SELECT * FROM students WHERE graduated = 'yes';
    
    - Retrieve all the classes taught before June this year
    
    SELECT * FROM classes WHERE date < '2022-02-02';
    
    - Retrieve all the students (retrieving student ids only is fine) who attended the Javascript class (or any other class that you have in the `classes` table).
    
    select * FROM students WHERE id in (SELECT student_id FROM attendance WHERE class_id = 1);
    SELECT students.name FROM students INNER JOIN attendance ON (students.id = attendance.student_id) INNER JOIN classes ON (classes.id = attendance.class_id) WHERE classes.topic='Node';
```

When you have finished all of the questions - open a pull request with your answers to the `Databases-Homework` repository.

## Task

1. Create a new database called `cyf_classes` (hint: use `createdb` in the terminal)
2. Create a new table `mentors`, for each mentor we want to save their name, how many years they lived in Glasgow, their address and their favourite programming language.
3. Insert 5 mentors in the `mentors` table (you can make up the data, it doesn't need to be accurate ;-)).
4. Create a new table `students`, for each student we want to save their name, address and if they have graduated from Code Your Future.
5. Insert 10 students in the `students` table.
6. Verify that the data you created for mentors and students are correctly stored in their respective tables (hint: use a `select` SQL statement).
7. Create a new `classes` table to record the following information:

   - A class has a leading mentor
   - A class has a topic (such as Javascript, NodeJS)
   - A class is taught at a specific date and at a specific location

8. Insert a few classes in the `classes` table
9. We now want to store who among the students attends a specific class. How would you store that? Come up with a solution and insert some data if you model this as a new table.
10. Answer the following questions using a `select` SQL statement:
    - Retrieve all the mentors who lived more than 5 years in Glasgow
    - Retrieve all the mentors whose favourite language is Javascript
    - Retrieve all the students who are CYF graduates
    - Retrieve all the classes taught before June this year
    - Retrieve all the students (retrieving student ids only is fine) who attended the Javascript class (or any other class that you have in the `classes` table).
